    <h1> Blog Section!</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the Blog Section. Here you will find updates, devlogs and more!</p>

    <h2> Blog Post 2 - Week 2</h2>
    <h3> HTML Fundamentals and the World Wide Web</h3>
     
   <p>Still very simple, but I added sections for the Blog, Essays and Portfolio sections. For now, I’ve decided to create these sections as templates for when I actually begin filling them with content. Currently, all my sections are on the homepage. I will change this as soon as I develop my folder structure. My goal for now, is to make it website quite simple, first learning the basics of HTML and folder structures before moving onto move complex stuff. At the moment, I’m considering a folder structure similar to this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Index.html</li>

        <li> Blog Folder:
            <li>Blog1.html
                <li>Blog2.html</li>
                <li>Blog3.html</li>
               <li>Blog4.html</li>
            </li>
            
            <li> Portfolio Folder:
                Portfoliowork1.html</li>
                Portfoliowork2.html</li>
                Portfoliowork3.html</li>
            </li>
            <li>Essay Folder:
                Essay1.html</li>
                Essay2.html</li>
                Essay3.html</li>
            </li>
            
            <li>Images Folder:
                Image1.html</li>
                Image2.html</li>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </li>

            <p>An article by Stony Brook University mentioned that a folder structure should be “pages should be organized logically into folders according to the sitemap. Each content area of the site must have a corresponding section folder. A section folder should always have a home page, also called an index page.” (Stony Brook University, 2024)</p>

            <p>Hanli mentioned that adding alt text to images can be important in situations where the user is visually impaired or has a slow connection. This way the image can still be described to them. I will make sure to add alt text to my images.</p>

            <P>Some inspirational websites for this week:</P>

             <ul>
                <li>https://www.sae.edu.za/courses/game/higher-certificate-in-game-design-and-production-full-time/</li>
                <li>https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US</li>
                <li>https://www.reachthefinals.com/</li>
                <li>https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Looking at these inspirational websites, I think I’m starting to notice a pattern. I seem to prefer websites that have a dark colour theme, moving graphics and a limited number of colours. For me, this helps create a modern and sleek feel on a website.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <img src="C:\WSOA3028A_2551187\Homepage Wireframe1.png" alt="A image illustrating the wireframe design of the homepage" width="1920" height="1080">

             <h2>Reflection on Reading</h2>
             <p>With regards to the reading by Moulthrop, I would like to focus on this particular quote “Hypertext is all about connection, linkage, and affiliation. Formally speaking, its universe is the one Thomas Pynchon had in mind when he defined “paranoia” as ‘the realization that everything is connected, everything in the Creation—not yet blindingly one, but at least connected. . . .'” (Moulthrop, 2003). This highlights what hypertext is all about, connection. Since websites use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to display information to users, it is important to note that everything on the website needs to be connected in some way. Whether it be code referencing another line of code from a different folder, or a webpage that links to another webpage, the experience needs to be almost seamless, with the only friction being the user’s internet connection. This is even more relevant today where there a so many websites that offer the same service or content, that any interruption for the user could result in them visiting another website instead, potentially losing a customer or viewer.</p>
