            <p>Changes To Include Javascript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="full-post">
            <p>When I started implementing Javascript into my website, it came with a few challenges:</p></br>
            <p>Well, I was not really experienced with it! But lectures and online tutorials do wonders when it comes to learning something new.</p>
            <p>I decided to implement a 'read more' button on my blog posts. It worked perfectly! And then for someone unknown reason, it just stopped working as well as it used to. No changes were made, it just stopped. I have tried to fix the problem, but nothing I have done has seemed to fix it. Rewriting the coed, duplicating it from pages that work, it just seems to work on a few pages and not on others. Which is interesting, especially since it worked fine when I submitted Website 2!</a></p>
        <p>Reading: The Road to Technocolonialism.</p>
        <p>The reading focuses on the effects AI could have on the world, introducing a new form of colonialism called 'Technocolonialism'. This could pose a threat to underdevelop regions, especially from more technologically advanced regions. The more developed countried might lend newer technology to less developed countries, in exchange for political gain. This could also open up the possibility of more increased surveillance. </p>
