            <p>This reading focuses on how the internet has been used and can be used to reduce costs, especially when travelling.</p></br>
            <p>As I had previously mentioned, transportation becomes much easier with the internet. People are able to find the cheapest and quickest way to travel using the mobile phones. Apart from this, booking accomodation has also become a significantly easier process using the internet. Websites like <a href="https://www.booking.com">Booking.com</a> allow people to not only find a cheap price for a hotel, but also reviews from other users, allowing them to shape their expectations and make a decision around that.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, this can also increase profits for business owners. Users are more likely to visit a place that has good ratings, which can be easily found using search engines like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></p>
