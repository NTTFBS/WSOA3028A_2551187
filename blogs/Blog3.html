    <h2> Blog Post 3 - Week 3</h2>
    <time datetime="2024-03-01">March 1, 2024</time>
    <h3> 3 Weeks, 3 Webpages</h3>
    <div class="blog-post">
        <div class="preview">
   <p>I have now created individual pages for the Blog, Essay and Portfolio pages. I have also added the HTML5 tag to my website. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="full-post">
   <p>I have added hyperlinks to all the pages of my website, making it easier to view each page. I have also added that text says “You are here” on the page that is currently being viewed, to help the viewer navigate the site easier.</p>
   
   <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>The alignment of a website is very important, as it defines it’s reason for existing. It highlights the goals of the website and helps to create the desired user experience around those goals. Different websites have different goals. A website dedicated to showing compilations of comic strips would probably focusing on less clicking, more scrolling to ensure an uninterrupted reading experience for the reader. </p>
 
    <p>I want to focus on creating an intuitive, interactive, but simple website. Using images and to capture the user’s attention and to supplement their viewing experience. </p>


    <h2>Homepage</h2>
    <p>This will be the landing page of the website, the first page users will see. Therefore, it needs to be as easy to understand as possible. There will be sections that provide links to other pages and a simple welcome and about message.</p>

    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>Blog page containing a collection of all my blogs (just like this one). This will serve as a design journal, documenting my process of designing this website and some interesting things I find while doing so. It will be arranged from first to last post, although I think having the latest post show up first would probably be a good idea. Time to learn how to do that!</p>
     
    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>A collection of art I produce that I find interesting enough to share.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I’m glad to have learned about the fundamentals of HTML up to this point, although I’m not quite where I’d like to be. This is mainly due to me not practicing enough and not doing enough research, but I will definitely change that!</p>


            <p>I found some good guidelines to follow with regards to web design in an article by Roslyn Raward. The article details a checklist which include linking all pages back to the homepage and the limited use of graphics to avoid distracting the user (Raward, 2001).</p>
