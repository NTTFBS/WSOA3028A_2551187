            <p> Internet, Society and Justice. (Tataki, Glynos, 2020) - (my second time doing this because I forgot to save)</p>

            <p>As mentioned in the first paragraph, "But, beside the difficulties of using mobile phones for learning, 40% of students do not have any form of access to the Internet at home" (Tataki, Glynos, 2020).</p></br>
            <p>The statement before this mentions that according to UNESCO, 830 million out of classroom students do not have a computer. These statistics are shocking when considering the fact that many schools across the world stopped physical classes and shifted to online learning. It would be possible to assume that many of these students did not receive proper information about their school work, leading to them possibly falling behind.</p>
            <p>This as definitely given me a better appreciation for the access to technology we have today.</p>
