    <h1> Blog Section!</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the Blog Section. Here you will find updates, devlogs and more!</p>

    <h2> Blog Post 1 - Week 1</h2>
        <p>Well, I have just realised that I should have been posting these blog posts in the discussion tab as well…oops ☹.</p>

        <p>With regards to my work for website 1… I’m glad that I learned the basics of making a website. I now have a new skill to develop, which is learning HTML or rather expanding my understanding of it. I could have done much more though. I feel as though a lot of my website work is just basic. When it comes to putting my website ideas on paper (or whatever the digital equivalent of that is), I find that it has been somewhat difficult. I’m not quite where I would like to be in HTML, but I hope to learn more!</p>
