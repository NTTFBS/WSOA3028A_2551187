            <p>Well, I have just realised that I should have been posting these blog posts in the discussion tab as well…oops ☹.</p>

            <p>With regards to my work for website 1… I’m glad that I learned the basics of making a website. I now have a new skill to develop, which is learning HTML or rather expanding my understanding of it. I could have done much more though. I feel as though a lot of my website work is just basic. When it comes to putting my website ideas on paper (or whatever the digital equivalent of that is), I find that it has been somewhat difficult. I’m not quite where I would like to be in HTML, but I hope to learn more!</p>
            <p>Here is a visual representation of what the user flow of my website should be like:</p>

            <p>And here is a visual representation of what the information structure of my website should be like:</p>

            <p>An article by Jenn Marie of SlickPlan breaks down good user flow into the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The goals of the user
                </li>
                <li>
                    The values of the user
                </li>
                <li>
                    Information needed by the user to complete the identified task
                </li>
                <li>
                    Potential hesitations or barriers for the user.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to put the user's needs first, as they are who the website is being made for, so their experience needs to be simple and enjoyable.</p>
