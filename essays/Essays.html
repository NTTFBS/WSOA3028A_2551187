    <h3> Digital Colonialism</h3>
    
       
        <h3 style=" text-align: center;"> Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h3>
        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Introduction</h3>

        <p>The following essay aims to discuss how ‘digital colonialism’ affects developers in South Africa today, by drawing on the main ideas presented by Sareeta Amrute in Tech Colonialism Today (Amrute, 2019), and Google’s decision to focus on outsourcing positions to Mexico and India (Elias, 2024). Additionally, this essay aims to highlight the importance of the internet on the economy in the digital age.</p>


        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">“What has already come…”</h3>
        <p>1881 to 1914. A time period that represents control and wealth gain for the kings and queens of Europe, but oppression and division for the people of Africa. (‘History Skills, 2024). ‘The Scramble for Africa’ as it is commonly referred to as, marked one of the most famous cases of theft and exploitation in history, referred to as ‘colonialism’. A period where “European empires were able to put aside their differences to milk Africa so to speak” (World History Edu, 2022), in an effort to gain wealth and control.
            According to Oxford Languages, ‘colonialism’ is “the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically” (Oxford Languages, 2024). Put simply, colonialism focuses on the control of an area and it’s resources. Colonies are quite rare today, with roughly 17 out the previously 80 colonies still existing today (United Nations, 2022), with many considering the period of ‘global colonialism’ to be over. 
            However, if colonialism in the past aimed to take control of resources in an age when natural resources were more abundant (Ritchie, 2021), how much more would it hold up in a world where infrastructures have made the shift from physical to digital? And lastly, how would colonialism hold up in the digital age, where the entire workforce behind a company can be hired from anywhere in the world, regardless of nationality?
        </p>


        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">“Will come again…”</h3>
        <p>2024. “Google lays off hundreds of ‘Core’ employees, moves some positions to India and Mexico” (Elias, 2024). Despite being responsible for the development of systems and products which are critical to the core function of the company, in April of 2024, Google made the decision to lay off employees and instead hire their corresponding roles in Mexico and India, where labour is much cheaper than the US (Livingcost, 2024).
            Perhaps Google was losing money and was desperately searching for a way to increase revenue? That argument might have held up if it were not for the following information. It is important to note that in Q1 of 2023, Google generated $70 billion in revenue, which increased to $80.5 billion in Q1 of 2024 (Haranas, 2024). Despite a 15 percent increase in revenue, core employees were still laid off in favour of cheaper labour, which ultimately makes the company more money.
            In an effort to ensure that employees are not simply left unemployed, Google has stated that the laid off core employees would be able to apply for open roles within the company (Elias, 2024). This begs the question, if an employee that occupies a core role within Google can be replaced in an instant, what might happen to employees occupying temporary or ‘less important’ roles? This decision by Google has highlighted a threat to job security in the Digital Age, as new employees hired in Mexico and India can effectively be paid less for the same amount of (or potentially even more) work than a US employee, due to the lower cost of living in these countries. Employees in a country with a lower cost of living are therefore favoured over their US counterparts. 
            In countries with a lower cost of living, the outsourcing of work from US companies raises ethical concerns with regards to the potential exploitation of workers, in which workers may experience lower wages (than their US counterparts), while working longer hours (Catacutan, 2023). This effectively leads to the exploitation of individuals by more powerful entities in an effort to gain more wealth, which sounds quite similar to the characteristics associated with colonialism. How might colonialism be classified in an age where physical land and natural resources are no longer the main focus? 
        </p>


        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Digital Colonialism</h3>
        <p>In ‘Tech Colonialism Today’ (Amrute, 2019), Sareeta Amrute questions whether, “we, as anthropologists and research practitioners, may be part of industries that are colonial” (Amrute, 2019). This question leads to the comparison between historical colonialism and Tech or Digital Colonialism, in which Amrute unpacks the characteristics of a colonial relationship.
            Amrute uses three distinct characteristics to determine whether or not an industry might be considered ‘colonial’. These three characteristics are: Hierarchical, extractive and exploitative. 
        </p>

        <h4 style=" text-align: center;">Hierarchical</h4>
        <p>Amrute argues that ‘tech’ is hierarchical, as the major companies which produce social media platforms and applications, share the belief that, “people located primarily in Silicon Valley… are the best people to deploy a small set of algorithmic applications to administer human life” (Amrute, 2019). This point is particularly interesting, as according to Investopedia, 38 of the Fortune 500 companies were located in Silicon Valley in 2020 (Investopedia, 2020). These companies include Apple, Meta and the aforementioned Google. </p>
        <h4 style=" text-align: center;">Extractive</h4>
        <p>The second characteristic is presented by Amrute explaining the extractive nature of tech, as it relies on mining minerals from the ground for parts, as well as an extraction of information in which anthropologist Cori Hayden, explored how, “U.S. pharmaceutical companies extract biological and botanical knowledge from the people of Mexico in order to create new drugs” (Amrute, 2019). Supporting this point is a statement by the National Library of Medicine in a journal article titled, ‘Plant-derived natural products for drug discovery: current approaches and prospects’. The article states that “Nature has abundant source of drugs that need to be identified/purified for use as essential biologics, either individually or in combination in the modern medical field”. (Mohanty, 2022). The therapeutic properties of plants are then ‘repackaged’ and used to develop novel drugs (Mohanty, 2022).</p>
        <h4 style=" text-align: center;">Exploitative</h4>
        <p>The final characteristic used by Amrute to link tech to colonialism, is exploitation. Amrute mentions outsourcing and efficiency as potential causes for exploitation in tech related labour. According to an article by IndustryWeek which comments on the findings of Bloomberg, ‘Warehouses are tracking workers’ every muscle movement’ (Bloomberg, 2019). Employees wear a vest created by tech startup, StrongArm, which vibrates whenever they do something incorrectly. This is an effect to maximize work efficiency, however, researchers worry that these ‘productivity monitors’ might result in an employee being fired if, “if their performance dips” (Bloomberg, 2019).
            By providing these points, Amrute strengthens her argument on the colonial nature of the tech industry. As we have already highlighted the colonial practices of Google, StrongArm and pharmaceutical companies, it would be beneficial to analyse another case more closely rooted in software and game development. A company which also has ties to Silicon Valley.
        </p>

        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Digital Colonialism in Software development</h3>
        <p>Founded in 1975, Microsoft is considered one of the most influential companies in the computer industry. So influential, in fact, that this essay is being typed in a program provided by Microsoft, on an operating system which is also provided by Microsoft and will be submitted on a platform (Ulwazi/Canvas) which uses Microsoft to handle it’s logins.
            This section will focus on development process of one of the many products provided by Microsoft, the 2023 video game, Forza Motorsport, which was developed by Turn10 Studios, a subsidiary of Xbox Game Studios, a publisher that is part of Microsoft Gaming (Gematsu, 2022).
            According to an article by EWeek published in 2014, Microsoft made changes to it’s company policies which introduced a new time limit for external staff or contractors. (Hernandez, 2014). The ‘time limit’ referred to in the article is more accurately explained by Microsoft in their ‘Supplier Policy’, which states the following, “At the end of the 18 months [the contractor’s time period] , Microsoft will remove the Contractor’s corporate network and building access for a minimum of six months before granting access again” (Microsoft, 2017). This effectively means that a contractor can work for no more than 18 months on a single contract unless it is a full-time contract. This would then lead to a ‘rotation of contractors’ every 18 months. 
            According to an ex-employee of Microsoft, who was also part of the development process of Forza Motorsport, Adrian Campos, describes the development behind Forza as ‘exhausting’ (Campos, 2024). 
            An important point that Campos makes on the hiring process of Microsoft, is that, “Basically, the developers that Microsoft would hire on a contract basis—that is to say, for a fixed term without healthcare or benefits — could only work for a maximum of 18 months before being required to take six off.” (Campos, 2024). This policy allows to Microsoft to hire employees, without having to spend money on their healthcare or employment benefits, effectively reducing company expenses, while leaving contractors unemployed.
            Similar to Google’s massive lay off, the exploitative nature of Microsoft’s Supplier Policy highlights the prominence of digital colonialism in tech, making it much more difficult to argue against.
            But how does digital colonialism affect a country that has faced colonialism in the past?
        </p>

        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Digital Colonialism in South African Software development</h3>
        <p>The software development industry in South Africa is one that has shown rapid growth within the last decade, especially with the government’s support for the sector. Cape Town is often noted as a key development centre for software with companies such as Luno and Yoco being based in Cape Town (WebTonic, 2023).
            Additionally, the increase in the South African tech industry has also warranted the implementation of additional security, cybersecurity, which can also serve to create more employment opportunities for those interested in software development (Scriven, 2023). Due to the government’s support for emerging technologies, the tech market in South Africa is expected to reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.3 percent by 2029 (Mordor Intelligence, 2024).
            Although the software development industry in South Africa is an exciting emerging industry, a few concerns are raised:
        </p>



        <ul>
            <li>	According to Mordor Intelligence, Microsoft is ranked in third place for South Africa ICT Market Leaders (Mordor Intelligence, 2024). As previously mentioned, Microsoft has a policy in the United States which states that contractors (non-permanent employees) cannot have contracts longer than 18 months, threatening job security. If Microsoft decides to implement the same policy in South Africa, it could have detrimental effects on the economy as the unemployment rate is already at 32.9 percent (O’Regan, 2024). </li>
            <li>	Similarly, Google’s decision to build Dedicated Cloud Interconnect sites in South Africa, may create employment opportunities for South Africans in the short term, but as they have previously demonstrated, outsourcing work to countries with a lower cost of living is still a possible path for them to take.</li>
            <li>	Lastly, the government’s push for the software development industry to succeed could result in less funding opportunities for other sectors and industries and could potentially widen the gap of ‘digital illiteracy', leaving those not familiar with emerging technologies, without jobs (Robinson, 2015).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Decolonisation in the Digital Age</h3>
        <p>In order to fight against digital colonialism, it is essential for rules and regulations to be established. While terms such as ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ may be global terms to describe the difference between right and wrong, to decolonialise specific regions would first require us to analyse how they were colonised. For example, Birhane makes the point that, “African developers, start-ups, and policy makers working to solve local problems with home grown solutions, what is considered ethical and responsible needs to be seen as inherently tied to local contexts and experts” (Birhane, 2020). 
            Birhan also describes Vumacam, an AI powered surveillance system in South Africa, which functions as a profiler, which is compared to the Apartheid era of segregation (Birhane, 2020). If security systems are being trained simply on what is ‘observed’, then false judgments are expected.
            Ironically, the solution seems to be going back, rather than going forward, from a tech driven security perspective. People need to stop transferring ‘moral power’ to machines who have no sense of what morals are.
        </p>

        <h3 style=" text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, the cyclical nature of history seems to be especially prominent in colonialism, historical or digital. Those in power seem to only seek more power, with no regard for the individuals affected by their conquest. Whether the resource is the land of a farmer or information on a user, it is valued more than the human responsible for it.
            Due to this cyclical nature, the excitement associated with the emergence of new technologies, specifically in South Africa, is threatened by the exploitative characteristics of a new form of colonialism, digital colonialism.
