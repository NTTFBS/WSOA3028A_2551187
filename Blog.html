    <h3> HTML Fundamentals and the World Wide Web</h3>
    <div class="blog-post">
        <div class="preview">
    <p>After a quick lesson about the history of the internet (how did these people come up with this???) I learned how to setup my first website using GitPages. I have used GitHub before, when collaborating on a game project, but I had no idea that it can also be used to host a website on!</p>  
        </div>
    
        <div class="full-post">
    <p>Before setting up my website, I watched the lecture given on HTML Fundamentals and found the way websites work really interesting and complex, specifically the TCP handshake, TLS negotiation and all the infrastructure required to make it possible. Although I read over the documentation provided by Mozilla on MDN Web Docs, I’m still not entirely sure how the negotiation process between the server, browser, and computer work.</p>  
        
    <p> When comparing the demo Mike showed on how the first website looked, I must say that I’m glad we have all of these accessibility features today, especially easy to navigate UI. This gave me a new appreciation for good UI design and how it creates a meaningful user experience, especially by providing clarity on how to navigate a website. Nothing will make a user leave the site quicker than not being able to navigates the landing page.</p>  
        
    <p>A website that caught my attention while researching places to study Game Design at, is this: https://www.sae.edu.za/courses/game/higher-certificate-in-game-design-and-production-full-time/
        I like the ‘modern look’ of the website, it’s simple 3 colour theme and the images that slide up when scrolling. It makes it really easy to read the important bits in white, which are contrasted against by the black background. Additional information is shown using grey text.</p>
        
        <p>I found the reading on “Why you should choose HTML5 (2010)” by Lawson quite interesting, as it discusses a few HTML elements that are similar, but have different outputs. Lawson mentions how the use of the Section tag has no point as “Unfortunately, however, no browser implements HTML5 outlining, so there is no point in
        using Section tag” <cite>(Lawson, 2010)</cite>. This made me realize that a website is only as effective as it’s code, but it’s code is only as effective as the browser it runs on.</p>
        
        <p> With that being said, my goal for this course is to learn what makes a good website and how to apply it in practice. I’d like to learn about the ‘psychology’ of good UI/UX and what makes a user more likely to perform desired actions on a website. For now, I understand that having a simple design that is easy to navigate is important, but I would like to expand my understanding by learning how to properly implement that design across multiple websites, with different designs. </p>
        
            <p>Well, after the first week, this is what my website looks like:</p>

                 <h1> Site Heading</h1>
                <p>Site paragraph text.</p>

                <p>This doesn’t really look like the websites I see all the time, but then again, they probably weren’t made it a week by someone who has just started learning HTML.</p>
